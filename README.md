# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a CSV file "Amazon_data.csv" and "nhl_stats1.csv"

### Load the Data : Read the CSV file into a DataFrame.
### Understand the Structure : Check the shape and data types of the DataFrame.
### Summary Statistics:Generate descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of the data.
### Missing Values: Identify any missing values and their impact.
### Visualizations: Create plots to visualize distributions, relationships, and trends in the data.
### Correlation Analysis: Check for correlations between numerical variables.

## Things that I did while working on nhl project.

#### nunique() function provides the total number of uniques values present in each feature
#### column' method provides name of each column
#### info() function gives information about each feature such as no of samples (rows), no of columns along with their data
#### analyze the spread of the "games_played" column
#### No of matches played in 2017?
#### Maximum Number os matched played?
#### what is the most common age of player and how many players of that age are present during 1999-2018 leagues data ?
#### Total no of players in each position
#### Matplotlib plotly pie chart for visualization of total no of positions are represented
#### How is goal related to number of games played by different players?
#### Catogorical feature and contineous feature
#### No of goals per game for season 1999-2003
#### Two categorical features

## Things that I did while working on Amazon project.

#### Find and drop Duplicate Values
#### Removing unwanted characters and changing the data type
#### rating column
#### Reviews
#### Price Column
#### Saving
#### One Hot Encoding
#### Label Encoding
#### Dealing with missing values
#### Median imputation and KNN imputation technique


## What Was the Outcome
##### The project yielded several valuable insights and outcomes:
###### Data Integrity: The removal of duplicates and cleaning of data types enhanced the dataset's integrity, ensuring accurate analysis.
###### Insightful Visualizations: Plots and visualizations provided a clearer understanding of distributions, trends, and relationships among variables, aiding in data-driven decision-making.
###### Improved Data Quality: Handling missing values through imputation techniques improved the dataset's overall quality and usability for analysis.
###### Readiness for Modeling: The dataset was well-prepared for subsequent modeling or machine learning tasks, with encoded categorical features and a cleaned structure.
###### Found Patterns: The correlation analysis revealed important relationships between variables, which could inform business decisions or further research.
