# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a CSV file  Amazon_data.csv

### Load the Data : Read the CSV file into a DataFrame.
### Understand the Structure : Check the shape and data types of the DataFrame.
### Summary Statistics:Generate descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of the data.
### Missing Values: Identify any missing values and their impact.
### Visualizations: Create plots to visualize distributions, relationships, and trends in the data.
### Correlation Analysis: Check for correlations between numerical variables.
